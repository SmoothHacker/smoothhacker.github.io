I'm Scott. I'm a software engineer and secuirty researcher. I work on a wide variety of projects that involve reverse engineering, low-level systems development, and fuzzing. Below I have some projects that I have worked on.

## Projects
#### [Tuscan-Leather](http://github.com/SmoothHacker/Tuscan-Leather)
Linux Kernel snapshot fuzzer written from scratch using only KVM.
#### [Dwarf-Debug-Parser](https://github.com/SmoothHacker/dwarf-debug-parser)
A plugin for Binary Ninja that parses DWARF debug information to populate a binary with types, and the locations of functions and global variables via the DebugInfo API.
